Basic EC2, command line, and BLAST
==================================

Follow the instructions in :doc:`amazon/log-in-with-ssh-mac` or :doc:`amazon/log-in-with-ssh-win`.

----

Two points:

Your machine name is available `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArcOEBWnXSBidEVtNURjLU9fSHExbzhIdGhIMl9uc0E#gid=0>`__

Download a keyfile here: http://athyra.idyll.org/~t/uw-bootcamp.pem

----

You should now be at a '#' prompt.

Create a directory for yourself
-------------------------------

Type::

   cd /mnt

and then type::

   mkdir <NetID>

but replace ``<NetID>`` with your MSU NetID (or some distinguishing lowercase
name).

Then type::

   cd <NetID>
 
and ::

   pwd

It should say '/mnt/<NetID>'.  Here, you've created your own folder and
made it your current "working directory", which means it's where UNIX
will look for files and programs by default.

Download some data
------------------

Download the E. coli MG1655 protein data set::

   curl -O http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Escherichia_coli_K_12_substr__MG1655_uid57779/NC_000913.faa

This grabs that URL and saves the contents of 'NC_000913.faa' to the local
disk.

Next, download a Salmonella protein data set::

   curl -O http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Salmonella_enterica_Serovar_Typhimurium_var__5__CFSAN001921_uid212972/NC_021814.faa

Likewise, this creates a local copy of NC_021814.faa.

Let's take a quick look at these files::

   head NC_000913.faa
   head NC_021814.faa

These files contain a bunch of protein data from two different genomes.
What can we do with it??

Format for BLAST and run BLAST
------------------------------

Format the E. coli data set for BLAST and run BLAST of the Salmonella proteins
against the MG1655 protein set::

   formatdb -i NC_000913.faa -o T -p T
   blastall -i NC_021814.faa -d NC_000913.faa -p blastp -e 1e-12 -o salm.x.ecoli

Look at the first 50 lines of the output file::

   head -50 salm.x.ecoli

good, BLAST output!  But if you type 'wc salm.x.ecoli' you'll see that
this file has 462,000 lines in it -- surely you don't want to look at
each one?

Let's convert 'em to a CSV file, instead, that can be opened in Excel::

   python /usr/local/share/ngs-scripts/blast/blast-to-csv-with-names.py NC_021814.faa NC_000913.faa salm.x.ecoli > salm.x.ecoli.csv

Take a look at this file ::

   head salm.x.ecoli.csv

But ... this file is on our remote computer. How do we get this file onto
our *local* computer??  There are lots of ways of doing this; for now,
I've set up a Web server on your Amazon computer, so you can just type::

   ln -fs $PWD /var/www

and go to your computer name in your browser plus '/<NETID>.  You
should see a bunch of files, including 'salm.x.ecoli.csv'.  For an example,
go to::

   http://ec2-23-20-239-64.compute-1.amazonaws.com/titus/

Reciprocal BLAST calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to start in "your" directory::

    cd /mnt/<NETID>

Now, let's do the reciprocal BLAST, too::

   formatdb -i NC_021814.faa -o T -p T
   blastall -i NC_000913.faa -d NC_021814.faa -p blastp -e 1e-12 -o ecoli.x.salm

Extract reciprocal best hit::

   python /usr/local/share/ngs-scripts/blast/blast-to-ortho-csv.py NC_021814.faa NC_000913.faa salm.x.ecoli ecoli.x.salm > ortho.csv

This generates a file 'ortho.csv', containing the ortholog assignments and
their annotations.  Now download *that* to your local computer and take
a look at it in Excel.

Time for reflection
-------------------

Get together with those sitting around you and come up with three uses
for this kind of "batch BLAST" in your collective research, whatever
it may be.  We'll make a list!

A few post-tutorial links
-------------------------

Explore the NCBI bacterial genome site here: http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria

- '.faa' files are protein data sets;
- '.fna' files are genomic DNA;
- the rest are annotation files of various kinds.
