Using the IPython Notebook for graphing and data processing
===========================================================

Connect to your machine with https: that is, take your machine name from the
following google doc page,

   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArcOEBWnXSBidEVtNURjLU9fSHExbzhIdGhIMl9uc0E#gid=0

and put ``https://`` plus that machine name in your browser URL bar (3rd column.)

Then enter the password 'beacon' and you should be in!

We're going to start with 'graph-blast-bitscore'. You can see a static version of this notebook `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/2013-uw-zero-entry/rendered/graph-blast-bitscore.ipynb>`__.
