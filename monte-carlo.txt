Monte Carlo simulations
=======================

Connect to your machine with https: that is, take your machine name from the
following google doc page,

   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArcOEBWnXSBidEVtNURjLU9fSHExbzhIdGhIMl9uc0E#gid=0

and put ``https://`` plus that machine name in your browser URL bar (3rd column.)

(The IPython notebook password is 'beacon'.)

We will be looking at 'coin-flips.ipynb' and 'monty-hall.ipynb'.  You can see
static versions of them `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/2013-uw-zero-entry/rendered/coin-flips.ipynb>`__ and `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/2013-uw-zero-entry/rendered/monty-hall.ipynb>`__.
