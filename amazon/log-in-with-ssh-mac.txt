===========================================================
Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" (Mac version)
===========================================================

First, download a security key, in a .pem file, from:

       http://athyra.idyll.org/~t/uw-bootcamp.pem

Save it to your Desktop (or download it and then move it to your desktop).

Next, start Terminal (in Applications... Utilities...) and type::

  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/uw-bootcamp.pem

to set the permissions on the private key file to "closed to all evildoers".

Then type::

  ssh -i ~/Desktop/uw-bootcamp.pem root@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com


Here, you're logging in as user 'root' to the machine
'ec2-174-129-122-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'uw-bootcamp.pem' on your Desktop.


Note, you have to replace the stuff after the '@' sign with the name
of the host; see the red circle in:

At the end you should see text and a prompt that look like this:
