===========================================================
Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" (Mac version)
===========================================================

First, find your private key file; it's the .pem file you downloaded
from the previous Web page.  It should be in your Downloads folder.
Move it onto your desktop.

Next, start Terminal (in Applications... Utilities...) and type::

  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/msu-bootcamp

to set the permissions on the private key file to "closed to all evildoers".

Then type::

  ssh -i ~/Desktop/msu-bootcamp root@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com


Here, you're logging in as user 'root' to the machine
'ec2-174-129-122-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'msu-bootcamp' on your Desktop.


Note, you have to replace the stuff after the '@' sign with the name
of the host; see the red circle in:

At the end you should see text and a prompt that look like this:
